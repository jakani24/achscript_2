# achscript_2
the newer and definitly better version of achscript
After the disastereus version of achscript 1 with its horrible logic and hard to learn functions I started on a new version.
The first version of achscript 2.0 is nearly ready for presentation.
Expect a much better performance, a more C like syntax, new functionality and better security.
The supported functions are:
- if
- while
- else
- print
- scan 
- different math operations
- data types:
  int, char, file
- cmd command execution
- function loading from different files
- automatic variable type detection
- sleep/pause
  
more functions are planned for the future
